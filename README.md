## Learning how to create a web application with Django 5.0

This repository contains an example Django web application called `rango`
developed by following the excellent
[Tango with Django book (4)](https://www.tangowithdjango.com/)
by Dr Leif Azzopardi and Dr David Maxwell.

All mistakes are my own.
